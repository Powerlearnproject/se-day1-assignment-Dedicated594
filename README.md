List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the development of software applications, ensuring efficiency, quality, and reliability. It consists of several key phases such as (i) Planning: This is the initial phase where project goals, scope, and feasibility are determined. (ii) Requirement analysis: Developers gather and analyze user and business needs. (iii) System design: The software architecture and system components are defined. (iv) Development (Implementation: Programmers write the actual code based on design specifications. (v) Testing: The software is tested for bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. (vi) Deployment: It may be deployed in different environments (e.g., staging, production). (vii) Maintenance & Updates: Post-deployment, software needs continuous monitoring and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Feature	Waterfall Methodology	Agile Methodology**
(i) The Waterfall Approach is Linear and sequential while Agile Methodology is	Iterative and flexible. (ii) The structure	of the Waterfall Methodology is divided into fixed phases (planning → design → development → testing → deployment)	while that of Agile Methodology is continuous cycles of development (sprints) with frequent feedback. (iii) The flexibility of the Waterfall Methodology is Rigid, changes are difficult to implement once development starts. while that of Agile Methodology is highly adaptable, allows changes based on feedback. (iv) The user Involvement in Waterfall Methodology	Minimal until the final product is delivered	while that of Agile Methodology is continuous user involvement throughout the development process. (v) The delivery	of  Waterfall Methodology is one-time final product delivery	while that of Agile Methodology is incremental releases after each sprint. (vi) The testing of  Waterfall Methodology is	Done at the end of development.	while that of Agile Methodology is continuous testing throughout the process. (vii) The Waterfall Methodology is best for	Projects with well-defined requirements and strict timelines.	while that of Agile Methodology is for projects that require adaptability and frequent updates.
